# Weekday_motivational_application_using_Python
On the first day of each week, this project will send you a motivating quote through email.

To get this project work perfectly, first you need to open two mail account for testing. You can use your personal email too, but that's not recommended.

For Gmail:
<ol> Enable two step verification from the mail settings. </ol>
<ol> Go to Security --> App password --> Login again --> From the dropdown menu, select app category and device and then generate password. </ol>
<ol> Copy that password and paste it as the value of <b>my_pass</b> variable.</ol>
