# Weekday_motivational_application_using_Python
On the first day of each week, this project will send you a motivating quote through email.

### For Gmail:
<ol> Enable two step verification from the mail settings. </ol>
<ol> Go to Security --> App password --> Login again --> From the dropdown menu, select app category and device and then click generate password. </ol>
<ol> Copy that password and paste it as the value of <b>my_pass</b> variable.</ol>
<ol> Use those two mail id you created into the code. One for sending(for which you generated password for) and one fore receiving. </ol>

### For Yahoo:
<ol> Enable two step verification from the mail settings. </ol>
<ol> Go to Account info --> Account security --> Generate and manage password --> Login again --> Write down the app name and then click generate password. </ol>
